## My process

### Built withüß∞

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learnedüìñ

The main lesson from this project was using  CSS media queries. The media queries allow for the creation of responsive designs on different screens. In this case, it was changing the width of the social media card, on smaller devices it takes almost all the real estate width whereas on larger devices the width id reduced significantly.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
/* 
This is the simplest media query syntax.
The media-type can be all, print or screen and is optional
The media feature rule is the rule that should be satisfied for the CSS rules to be applied.
*/
@media media-type and (media-feature-rule){
  /* CSS Rules */
}
```

### Continued developmentüìñ

I have grapsed the CSS media-query topic and flexbox but more practice is still needed in order to fully engrave the concepts in my brain.


### Useful resourcesüìö

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries#more_complex_media_queries) - This helped me understand media queries and how to use them for responsive designs.
